    <p class="italic">“We are the defenders of Christian Europe,”</p>
    <p>
      declared Prime Minister Viktor Orbán during a national address, reinforcing his government's commitment to a conservative cultural framework. Hungary, he insists, must resist what he calls "liberal decay" coming from Western Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Policies introduced in recent years include financial incentives for families, strict immigration controls, and education reforms centered on national heritage and faith.
    </p>

    <p>
      Critics argue that these measures marginalize minority groups and silence opposition voices. However, Orbán’s supporters claim the approach is necessary to maintain Hungary’s sovereignty and cultural survival.
    </p>

    <p>
      International observers remain divided. Some view Hungary as a beacon of tradition in a rapidly shifting Europe; others see its government as increasingly authoritarian.
