    <p class="italic">“Colmar is booming. Mulhouse is trying to catch up,”</p>
    <p>
      says property developer Julien Meyer. The contrast between the two cities illustrates the uneven pace of development in the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Colmar benefits from tourism and cultural heritage, while Mulhouse faces higher unemployment and slower growth. Infrastructural projects are underway, but recovery takes time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Analysts note that young families still prefer affordable housing options, making Mulhouse potentially attractive — if economic stability improves.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, Haut-Rhin remains a patchwork of real estate realities — shaped by location, opportunity, and long-term vision.
